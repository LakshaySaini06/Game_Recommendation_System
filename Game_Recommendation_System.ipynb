        "The modern gaming market is saturated with thousands of titles released annually. Gamers often suffer from **\"decision paralysis\"**\u2014spending more time scrolling through libraries (Steam, Epic, Game Pass) than actually playing. Existing discovery tools either rely heavily on massive historical data (cold start problem) or generic popularity metrics.\n",

        "### 1.2 Objective\n",
        "The goal is to build **\"YourNextGame\"**, a lightweight, privacy-focused web application that recommends games based on two key vectors:\n",
        "1.  **Current Mood**: Immediate user preference (e.g., \"I want something Chill\", \"I want Adrenaline\").\n",
        "2.  **Demographic Profile**: Statistical preferences based on Age, Gender, and Region (e.g., \"Strategy games are popular in EU\").\n",

        "### 1.3 Project Track & Real-World Relevance\n",
        "*   **Selected Track**: AI/ML Web Application.\n",
